Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Objective: Predict forest cover type based on cartographic variables.
Description:  Analyzed dataset with features like elevation, aspect, slope, and soil type.
Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values.
Applied feature engineering to create new features.
Trained models including Random Forest and SVM.
Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Gained insights into the relationship between cartographic variables and forest cover types.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Key Achievements:
Ensured data quality through extensive cleaning and preprocessing.
Built and compared models with strong predictive performance.
Acquired practical experience in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.
